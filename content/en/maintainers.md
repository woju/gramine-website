The people behind Gramine
{{< /intro >}}

Graphene started in 2011 as a research project at Stony Brook University, led
by Chia-Che Tsai and Don Porter, contributed by many students and first
released in 2014. In 2015, SGX support was developed in cooperation with Intel
Labs, along with the first Graphene release for SGX. Over the subsequent years,
multiple research and industrial users have contributed to the project. In
2017, Golem, Invisible Things Labs (ITL), and Intel began making significant
investments in the project.

In 2018, the project adopted a formal working group and project policies, in
order to encourage and manage growth of the community. The working group is
guiding the process of making Graphene production-ready, and setting a roadmap
for future development. The group is lead by a team from ITL, Intel, and the
original researchers (now at UNC Chapel Hill and Texas A&M University).
